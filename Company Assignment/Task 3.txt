    FROM Employee e LEFT JOIN Courier c ON e.EmployeeID = c.EmployeeID GROUP BY e.EmployeeID, e.Name;

15. Calculate the total revenue generated by each location 

    SELECT l.LocationID, l.LocationName, SUM(p.Amount) AS TotalRevenue FROM location l 
    LEFT JOIN payment p ON l.LocationID = p.LocationID GROUP BY l.LocationID, l.LocationName;
 
16. Find the total number of couriers delivered to each location.

    SELECT l.LocationID, l.LocationName, COUNT(c.CourierID) AS TotalCouriersDelivered FROM location l
    LEFT JOIN courier c ON l.LocationID = c.LocationID WHERE c.Status = 'Delivered'
    GROUP BY l.LocationID, l.LocationName;
  
17. Find the courier with the highest average delivery time:  

    SELECT CourierId, AVG(DATEDIFF(DeliveryDate, (SELECT MIN(DeliveryDate) FROM courier 
    WHERE CourierId = c.CourierId))) AS AvgDeliveryTime FROM courier c
    GROUP BY CourierId ORDER BY AvgDeliveryTime DESC LIMIT 1;

18. Find Locations with Total Payments Less Than a Certain Amount  

     SELECT l.LocationID, l.LocationName, SUM(p.Amount) AS TotalPayments FROM location l LEFT JOIN
     payment p ON l.LocationID = p.LocationID GROUP BY l.LocationID, l.LocationName
     HAVING TotalPayments < 100;


19. Calculate Total Payments per Location 

    SELECT l.LocationID, l.LocationName, SUM(p.Amount) AS TotalPayments FROM location l 
    LEFT JOIN  payment p ON l.LocationID = p.LocationID GROUP BY l.LocationID, l.LocationName;
 
20. Retrieve couriers who have received payments totaling more than $1000 in a specific location 
(LocationID = X):  
    
     SELECT c.CourierId, SUM(p.Amount) AS TotalPayments FROM courier c LEFT JOIN payment p 
     ON c.CourierId = p.CourierId WHERE p.LocationId = 1 GROUP BY c.CourierId
     HAVING TotalPayments > 1000;

21. Retrieve couriers who have received payments totaling more than $1000 after a certain date 
(PaymentDate > 'YYYY-MM-DD'):  

     SELECT c.CourierId,SUM(p.Amount) AS TotalPayments FROM courier c LEFT JOIN payment p 
     ON c.CourierId = p.CourierId WHERE p.PaymentDate > '2023-12-25' GROUP BY c.CourierId
     HAVING TotalPayments > 1000;

22. Retrieve locations where the total amount received is more than $5000 before a certain date 
(PaymentDate > 'YYYY-MM-DD')  

    SELECT l.LocationID,l.LocationName,SUM(p.Amount) AS TotalAmountReceived
    FROM location l LEFT JOIN payment p ON l.LocationID = p.LocationID
    WHERE p.PaymentDate <= '2024-12-25' GROUP BY l.LocationID, l.LocationName
    HAVING TotalAmountReceived > 5000;
